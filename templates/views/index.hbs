                    <p class="info">Joey is an award-winning filmmaker and cinematographer and a former regular contributor to Richmond's premiere cinema open mic, Project Res. In the wake of the conclusion of its first wave in 2009 he went on to make and be involved with several films in the Richmond area, including Eric Miller's midnight B-movie and horror parody TV series, "Midnight Frights," which can be found on your local Idea Station, and his own short, "Singularium" (2011), now available on iTunes. After appearing for a support role in Drew Bolduc and Dan Nelson's "The Taint" (2010), he has made his foray into live performance on stage doing improv comedy at the Coalition Theater. </p>

                    <p class="info">In 2005, while attending VCU, Shawn Hambright auditioned to appear in a short being produced by one Joey Tran, and the two have since worked together on numerous projects. Together they made the award winning shorts MegaChiroptera! and The TREEzilla!, the latter screening at the VMFA in 2011 as a part of the James River Shorts Festival. Shawn also helped launch Midnight Frights as a writer, and composed and recorded the end title theme. In 2014, Shawn wrote, directed, and scored Double Takeâ€™s entry into the Richmond 48 Hour Film Project, which took home awards for Best Writing and Best Sound Design. Shawn can be found just about every other Saturday night at the Coalition Theater, where he performs improv with the house team The Johnsons. </p>
